## Background
Towards zero is the 2016-2020 road safety strategy for the state of Victoria. The strategy is a collaboration between multiple Victorian government bodies including the Transport Accident Commission, VicRoads, Victorian Police, the Department of Justice and Regulation and the Department of Health and Human Services to achieve zero road deaths in Victoria.

The short term objective of the collaboration is to reduce annual road fatalities to below 200 by 2020 and reduce serious injuries, which require hospital admission, by 15% over the 5 year period between 2016-2020.

The Towards Zero campaign in centered upon the mantra of safer roads, safer speeds, safer vehicles and safer road users through improving infrastructure, focused education campaigns, increased monitoring and implementing innovations.

Since the implementation of the Towards Zero strategy, progress has been made to reduce both road fatalities and serious injuries. An additional factor to consider as part of road safety are the external weather conditions road users are subject to.

How do


### Weather Conditions as a Factor of Road Safety
_ARTICLES CONSDIERING IMPACT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS ON ACCIDENTS_
The number of injury accidents that are recorded during inclement weather has led rain to be considered as the major meteorological explanatory factor for road accident risk (Brodsky & Hakkert 1988).


Weather conditions are considered to be a factor that affects the number of road accidents and casualties significantly, with different effects according to the type of road (motorways, rural roads or urban roads). 

Fair weather favours mobility, while cold spells reduce it, and it seems natural to consider temperature as an appropriate variable for representing the regular changes in mobility during the year, as well as the atypical changes in mobility that occur in the event of unusually hot or cold weather. 

Extreme weather conditions or other natural phenomena can make large parts of the road network impassable.


## Proposed Research Questions
To further investigate the effect of external factors on Victorian road accidents, the following research questions are being proposed:   
1. How, and to what extent, do different weather conditions affect road accidents?   
2. What is the probability of a road accident occuring during wet weather, given the age of the driver?   
3. What changes, if any, to the Towards Zero campaign are recommended?   

## Data Sets
_Range of datasets examined, chosen for the analysis. How datasets were merged. Is granularity of data sufficient to answer research questions_


## Regression Modelling
_Regression modelling techniques to be employed_


## Issues
Throughout the project, the following have been identified as potential issues to consider and address:
- accurately assigning weather conditions to each road accident
- merging and joining data sets
- working with low quality data sets
- compensating for missing explanatory variables
- complexity of capturing and measuring weather variables

It raises a number of issues, most importantly, how can we determine which meteorological phenomena significantly influence the road risk level, which variables are to be chosen for measuring them and also on which time scale should the weather be measured to be significant on a monthly time scale.

### Data Acquisition


### Data Merging


We have planned to determine the rainfall in the place of the accident by taking data from the closest weather station. In order to do that, we will need to cross join the weather station data and accident's data and then find the distance between these two. The cross join returns m*n number of results. Then we will take only those readings contain minimum value of distance calculated.

#### Installation of packages

``` {r install_load_libraries, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("geosphere",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")

library(tidyverse)
library(geosphere)
```

##Loading data into variables
Creating a dummy weather data
``` {r create_weather_data, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weather <- data.frame(
			 station_number= c(1121),
			 rainfall = c(10),
	     station_longitude= c(145),
	     station_latitude = c(-37)
	)
```

Loading accident data (only 1000 are loaded for the sake of example)
``` {r load_crash_data, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
crashes <- read.csv("Crashes_Last_Five_Years.csv",nrows=1000)
```

##Perform a cross join
So now we will perform a cross join of the crash data and weather data

``` {r cross_join_data, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weather_crashes <- merge(weather, crashes %>% select(ACCIDENT_NO, ACCIDENT_DATE, LONGITUDE, LATITUDE), all= TRUE)
```

##Calculate the distance
Finally, we can get the distance by using the crossed data table.

``` {r distance_calculation, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weather_crashes_dist <- 
	weather_crashes %>% mutate(dist_station_crash = distHaversine(cbind(station_longitude, station_latitude), cbind(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE)))
```

##Our final data
We will obtain:

``` {r display_calculation }
head(weather_crashes_dist, 10)
```
